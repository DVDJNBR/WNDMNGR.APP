# Story 1.3: Operational Dashboard - Farm Overview

## 1. Context
The core value of the pivot is a secure dashboard. We need to port the SQL queries from the Evidence.dev handoff into SvelteKit loaders.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard layout created with a Farm Selection dropdown.
- [ ] Data loaders in `+page.server.ts` implement the queries from `RESOURCES/dashboard-handoff.md`.
- [ ] Dashboard displays:
    - General Farm Info (Project, SPV, Type).
    - Localisation (Region, Department, Municipality).
    - Status (Farm Status, TCMA).
    - Turbine Details (Manufacturer, Count, Power).
- [ ] UI is responsive and follows the modernization aesthetic.

## 3. Technical Notes
- Use the queries provided in `RESOURCES/dashboard-handoff.md`.
- Ensure SSR is used for all queries to keep the database connection private.
