# Story 1.3: Database Integration

**Epic:** Backend API (Cloudflare Worker / TypeScript)
**As a** Developer,
**I want** the API to securely connect to the Supabase (PostgreSQL) database,
**so that** it can perform data operations (read/write).

---

### Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** A modern, edge-compatible PostgreSQL client library for TypeScript (e.g., `node-postgres`) is added as a dependency.
*   **AC2:** The Supabase database connection string is stored securely as a Cloudflare Worker secret.
*   **AC3:** A data access layer or module is created to manage the database connection pool, ensuring efficient connection handling in the serverless environment.
*   **AC4:** A test endpoint (e.g., `GET /db-status`) is created to verify the connection to the database is successful.
*   **AC5:** The API can successfully execute a simple `SELECT` query on a test table.
*   **AC6:** All database interactions are wrapped in try/catch blocks to handle potential connection or query errors gracefully.
