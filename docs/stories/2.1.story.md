# Story 2.1: Frontend Project Setup

**Epic:** Frontend Application (Next.js)
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and a component library,
**so that** I have a foundational, version-controlled frontend structure ready for UI development.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** A new Next.js project is created using `create-next-app`.
*   **AC2:** The project is configured to use TypeScript.
*   **AC3:** A modern UI component library (e.g., **Material-UI (MUI)** or **Shadcn/ui**) is installed and configured.
*   **AC4:** The default Next.js boilerplate is replaced with a simple "Hello World" page that uses a component from the chosen UI library.
*   **AC5:** The project structure is organized to include directories for `components`, `pages`, `lib`, etc.
*   **AC6:** The project is committed to the Git repository in a new `frontend` directory (or similar, to separate it from the backend code).
*   **AC7:** A `README.md` file is created within the frontend project directory explaining how to install dependencies and run the local development server.
