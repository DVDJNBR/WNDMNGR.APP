# Story 1.4: Implement B2 API CRUD Endpoints

**Epic:** Backend API (Cloudflare Worker / TypeScript)
**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** a comprehensive set of secure REST API endpoints to manage wind farm data,
**so that** I can build the user-facing management features.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** API endpoints for **CRUD** operations on "Farms" are created:
    *   `GET /farms`: Returns a list of all farms.
    *   `GET /farms/{id}`: Returns a single farm by its ID.
    *   `POST /farms`: Creates a new farm.
    *   `PUT /farms/{id}`: Updates an existing farm.
    *   `DELETE /farms/{id}`: Deletes a farm.
*   **AC2:** All endpoints are protected by the Entra ID authentication middleware created in Story 1.2.
*   **AC3:** Input data for `POST` and `PUT` requests is validated (e.g., checking for required fields).
*   **AC4:** The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `200` OK, `201` Created, `400` Bad Request, `404` Not Found).
*   **AC5:** The logic for data extraction, aggregation, or specific calculations required by **B2 competencies (C8, C9, C10)** is implemented within these endpoints where applicable.
*   **AC6:** The API endpoints are documented using OpenAPI standards, and the documentation is accessible via a specific route (e.g., `/docs`).
