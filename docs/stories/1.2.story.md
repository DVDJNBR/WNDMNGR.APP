# Story 1.2: Implement Entra ID Authentication

**Epic:** Backend API (Cloudflare Worker / TypeScript)
**As a** User,
**I want** to log in securely using my Microsoft Entra ID credentials,
**so that** the API can identify me and apply the correct permissions.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC1:** The `msal-node` library is added as a dependency to the Cloudflare Worker project.
*   **AC2:** Configuration for Entra ID (Client ID, Tenant ID, Client Secret) is managed via Cloudflare Worker secrets/environment variables.
*   **AC3:** An endpoint (e.g., `/login`) is created to initiate the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow.
*   **AC4:** An endpoint (e.g., `/auth/callback`) is created to handle the redirect from Azure, exchange the authorization code for an access token, and validate it.
*   **AC5:** A middleware function is created in Hono to protect specific API routes, checking for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
*   **AC6:** A protected endpoint (e.g., `/me`) is created that returns the authenticated user's information from their token.
*   **AC7:** Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints receive a `401 Unauthorized` error.
